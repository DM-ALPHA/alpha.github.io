<h4>Dark Matter Is Not ‚ÄúFuzzy‚Äù</h4>
<p>New research published in Physical Review Letters by former OKC Fellow Keir Rogers and AxionDM PI Hiranya Peiris rules out one of the more popular and well-motivated dark matter candidates. Full OKC newsflash available <a href="http://www.okc.albanova.se/about-us/news/dark-matter-is-not-fuzzy-1.542051">here</a>.</p>

<h4>AxionDM at MultiHEP2020</h4>
<p>Alex Millar and Hiranya Peiris participated in a panel discussion about interdisciplinary collaborations for MultiHEP2020,  organised by the Instrumentation Cross-Cutting Group for the Snowmass process. Katie Dunne was an organiser of MultiHEP. Youtube video available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0akNlZgv28&amp;feature=youtu.be">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Postdoc opening in axion physics</h4>
<p>We are currently looking for one outstanding individual to work on axion theory and phenomenology, funded by a Starting Grant from the Swedish Science Council to David Marsh. The job advertisment can be found <a href="http://www.okc.albanova.se/about-us/vacancies/five-postdoctoral-positions-at-the-oskar-klein-centre-stockholm-1.517421">here</a> </p>

<h4>The plasma haloscope was introduced to the US-based Snowmass Process through a Letter of Interest (LoI)</h4>
<p>The LoI opens up avenues for collaboration through participation in workshops on axion physics and relevant detector technologies (quantum sensing and millimeter-wave detection). The process will continue through July of 2021 and culminate in a Contributed Paper on the plasma haloscope concept that will be part of the Snowmass Proceedings, and serve as input for the P5 physics prioritization panel. The LoI can be found <a href="https://www.snowmass21.org/docs/files/summaries/IF/SNOWMASS21-IF1-CF2-003.pdf">here</a> </p>
