- title: "Axion Quasiparticles for Axion Dark Matter Detection"
  image: 2102.05366.png
  description: The axion quasiparticles is a longitudinal antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation which mixes with the photon when an external magnetic field is applied. This mixing provides the photon with a tuneable mass, allowing for resonant conversion of axion dark matter into THz photons in a material volume that is independent of the resonant frequency. We develop a formalism for providing a realistic sensitivity estimate for an experiment. If appropriate materials are manufactured this method could allow for detection of axion DM in the mass range between 1 and 10 meV using current and near future technology.

- title: "Transient Radio Signatures from Neutron Star Encounters with QCD Axion Miniclusters"
  image: 2011.05377.png
  description: Axion miniclusters are dense bound structures of dark matter axions that are predicted to form in the post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking scenario. Here, we characterize the spatial distribution and properties of miniclusters in the Milky Way after undergoing tidal stellar interactions throughout their lifetime. We do this by performing an extensive set of Monte-Carlo simulations for iterative perturbations of individual miniclusters.

  image: 2011.05378.png
  description: The QCD axion is expected to form dense structures known as axion miniclusters if the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken after inflation. Miniclusters that have survived until today will interact with neutron stars (NSs) in the Milky Way to produce transient radio signals from axion-photon conversion in the NS magnetosphere. We quantify the properties of these encounters and find that they occur frequently; last between a day and a few months; are spatially clustered towards the Galactic centre; and can reach fluxes observable with...

  description: We present a general framework for obtaining robust bounds on the nature of dark matter using cosmological  N -body simulations and Lyman-alpha forest data. We construct an emulator of hydrodynamical simulations, which is a flexible, accurate and computationally-cheap model for predicting the response of the Lyman-alpha forest flux power spectrum to different dark matter models, the state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the primordial power spectrum.

  description: Axion helioscopes search for solar axions and axionlike particles via inverse Primakoff conversion in strong laboratory magnets pointed at the Sun. Anticipating the detection of solar axions, we determine the potential for the planned next-generation helioscope, the International Axion Observatory (IAXO), to measure or constrain the solar magnetic field. To do this we consider a previously neglected component of the solar axion flux at sub-keV energies arising from the conversion of longitudinal plasmons.

  description: "Dark photons (DPs) produced in the early Universe are well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidates. We show that the recently proposed tunable plasma haloscopes are particularly advantageous for DP searches. While in-medium effects suppress the DP signal in conventional searches, plasma haloscopes make use of metamaterials that enable resonant absorption of the DP by matching its mass to a tunable plasma frequency and thus enable efficient plasmon production."

  description: In the presence of an external magnetic field, the axion and the photon mix. In particular, the dispersion relation of a longitudinal plasmon always crosses the dispersion relation of the axion (for small axion masses), thus leading to a resonant conversion. Using thermal field theory, we concisely derive the axion emission rate, applying it to astrophysical and laboratory scenarios.
