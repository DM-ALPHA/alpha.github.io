  title: "The plasma haloscope was introduced to the US-based Snowmass Process through a Letter of Interest (LoI)"
  text: "The LoI opens up avenues for collaboration through participation in workshops on axion physics and relevant detector technologies (quantum sensing and millimeter-wave detection). The process will continue through July of 2021 and culminate in a Contributed Paper on the plasma haloscope concept that will be part of the Snowmass Proceedings, and serve as input for the P5 physics prioritization panel. The LoI can be found <a href='https://www.snowmass21.org/docs/files/summaries/IF/SNOWMASS21-IF1-CF2-003.pdf'>here</a> "
